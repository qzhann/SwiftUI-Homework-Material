# SwiftUI Homework Material

## What We Are Building  
We are building a suite of SwiftUI homework material to help students in ITP 342 use SwiftUI in a real-world setting.  
  
In each homework, we will guide the students to build a fully functional app. We will show them what to build, and step them through homework goals and requirements.  

## What We Are NOT Building  
We are building this suite of homework:  
- NOT to replace or complement existing homework, since they were designed with different goals and contexts in mind, and has served ITP 342 well for several semesters
- NOT to TEACH how to use SwiftUI, since the lectures are more suited to teach new materials, and the homework should serve more as a hands-on practice session
- NOT to cover all of the possible skills relevant to SwiftUI, since there are more than we could cover, and the APIs are expanding each year

## Goals: Minimum  
We want each of the homework to be at least:  
1. Delightful for students to follow through
    - Gives instructions that are simple to follow, avoids unnecessary strictness and vagueness
    - Encourages students to try out different layouts, color schemes, and contents
      
2. Suitable for students with varying levels of interest in the class
    - Gives general, adaptable requirements, avoids too much detail and strictness
    - Graded requirements should be simple, general, and adaptable
    - Encourages students to expand the appâ€™s functionality when possible 
      
3. Easy to debug  
    - Broken down into separate components that students can build and debug separately 
      
4. Easy to grade  
    - Asks students to include a README, listing requirements they have and have not satisfied
    - Asks students to record graded requirements on the simulator, and upload to Blackboard
    - Asks students to record extra-credit requirements separately, and upload to Blackboard
      
5. Decoupled from other homework in the suite, so that instructors can select any subsets of homework as they see fit  
    - Includes a list summarizing topics instructors should cover before assigning each homework
